Cast-R1 is a novel framework that reformulates **Time Series Forecasting** as an **evidence-driven sequential decision-making process**. It combines memory-based state management with tool-augmented reasoning and a two-stage learning strategy (supervised fine-tuning + multi-turn reinforcement learning) to enable adaptive evidence gathering, reasoning-based prediction, and iterative forecast refinement.

## 🔍 Overview

Existing time series forecasting methods often adopt a model-centric, single-pass formulation that treats prediction as a fixed mapping from historical observations to future values. Cast-R1 introduces an agentic paradigm:

- **Memory-based State Management**: Maintains decision-relevant context across forecasting steps, enabling accumulation of contextual evidence for long-horizon reasoning.
- **Tool-Augmented Workflow**: Relies on a modular **Forecasting Toolkit**—data quality assessment, global statistical characterization, structural and dynamic analysis, event-level summarization, residual diagnostics, and forecasting model invocation—for context-aware predictive analysis.
- **Two-Stage Learning**: Supervised fine-tuning initializes basic forecasting competence and stable tool-usage behaviors; multi-turn reinforcement learning (GRPO) optimizes long-horizon decision policies under curriculum learning.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Sequential Decision Formulation**: Forecasting as a sequence of interdependent decisions (feature preparation → model selection → reasoning-based prediction → iterative refinement) rather than single-pass inference.
- **Forecasting Toolkit**: Data quality assessment, statistical characterization, structural analysis, event summarization, residual diagnostics, and adaptive model invocation (ARIMA, PatchTST, iTransformer, Chronos-2, etc.).
- **Memory-based State Abstraction**: Dynamic state management that retains critical historical information across decision steps, enabling effective credit assignment.
- **Self-Reflective Refinement**: Agent validates intermediate forecasts against historical constraints and refines unreasonable artifacts (e.g., impossible spikes, negative prices).
- **Strong Benchmark Performance**: Consistent improvements over statistical, deep learning, foundation, and LLM-based baselines on ETT, Wind, and electricity price forecasting (NP, PJM, BE, FR, DE).

## 📊 Benchmark Results

**Main Results (MSE / MAE):**

Cast-R1 achieves the lowest MSE on all evaluated datasets and ranks first or second on most MAE metrics, outperforming statistical (ARIMA, Prophet), deep learning (PatchTST, iTransformer, ConvTimeNet, TimeXer, DLinear), foundation (Chronos-2, TimesFM), and LLM-based (OFA, TimeLLM, TimeReasoner) baselines.

**Ablation Studies:**

- **Toolkit Components**: Removing feature extraction or model prediction degrades performance; model prediction has the largest impact on complex datasets.
- **Memory-based State**: Removing dynamic memory consistently increases forecasting error across all benchmarks.
- **Training Strategy**: Both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are essential; removing either stage leads to suboptimal results.
- **Curriculum Learning**: Exclusion of curriculum RL results in higher errors, especially on volatile benchmarks like PJM.
